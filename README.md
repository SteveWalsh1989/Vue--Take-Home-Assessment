## FrontEnd focused take home assessment to practice some Vue 3

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a one-page application with a list of people and the details about their related home planet.

The list of people and the information related to a planet can be accessed using the swapi api:

SWAPI api details: https://swapi.dev/

Wireframe description:

The candidate should implement a table that contains a list of users with the following information:
Name
Height
Mass

Planet Name

When the user clicks on the planet name a popup is displayed showing the following information regarding the planet:

The user should be able to sort the table by each column. The user should also be able to filter by searching the personâ€™s name.
